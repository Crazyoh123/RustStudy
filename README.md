# RUST-STUDY
<p>HI I HAVE CREATED THIS REPO  FOR SHARPEN MY CODING SKILLS ON RUST</p>
<p>Write a program to find the sum of all numbers from 1 to N.<br>

<h1>NUMERICAL PROBLEMS:</h1>
<p>

Implement a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.<br>
Write a program to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.<br>
Create a function to determine if a given number is a palindrome.</p>

</p>

<h1>String Problems</h1>
<p>
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
Implement a program to find the length of the longest word in a sentence.
Create a function to count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.
