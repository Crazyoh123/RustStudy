# RUST-STUDY
<p>HI I HAVE CREATED THIS REPO  FOR SHARPEN MY CODING SKILLS ON RUST</p>

<h1>NUMERICAL PROBLEMS:</h1>
<p>
Implement a function to check if a given number is prime or not.<br>
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.<br>
Create a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.<br>
Implement a program to find the largest prime factor of a given number.<br>
Write a function to check if a number is a perfect square or not.<br>
Create a program to find the nth term of the arithmetic progression given the first term, common difference, and the value of n.<br>
Implement a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.<br>
Write a program to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.<br>
Create a function to determine if a given number is a palindrome.</p>

<h1>ARRAY PROBLEMS</h1>
<p>
Write a program to find the maximum element in an array.<br>
Implement a function to reverse the elements of an array.<br>
Create a program to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.<br>
Write a function to check if an array is sorted in ascending order.<br>
Implement a program to remove duplicate elements from an array.<br>
Create a function to find the second smallest element in an array.<br>
Write a program to rotate the elements of an array to the right by a given number of positions.<br>
Implement a function to find the median of an array.<br>
Create a program to find the intersection of two arrays (i.e., common elements).<br>
